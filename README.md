# Angel Defence

**Angel Defence** is a multi part 10-week project that consisted of not only delivering a working prototype but also formal documentation, user testing, video production but most of all, the difficulty in working with a legacy system that uses CoffeeScript. In this time period, we built two new arena levels for CodeCombat students to test their Python coding aptitude, each consisting of three levels of difficulty - easy, medium, and hard.

In our first arena, **[Angel Defence 1](https://codecombat.com/play/ladder/angel-defence-1)**, the players’ objective is to summon different types of units to protect their base. The winner is decided as the team whose base survives the longest. We recommend players complete CodeCombat courses *'Computer Science 1'* to *'Computer Science 3'* before attempting the game.

In our second arena, **[Angel Defence 2](https://codecombat.com/play/ladder/angel-defence-2)**, the player’s objective is to destroy the opponent’s base while defending their own. Players have the ability to spawn and control different types of units, including controlling their hero unit. We recommend players complete CodeCombat courses *'Computer Science 4'* to *'Computer Science 6'* before attempting the game.
